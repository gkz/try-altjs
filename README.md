#Try altJS

A web-based test suite designed to showcase the differences between various altJS languages.

Consists of a left pane for choosing the current language and example code, and a pair of "before and after" panes for input and output.

The input and output areas are both driven by CodeMirror 2. The output pane is read-only and updates live as changes are made to the input. Output is also displayed with JavaScript syntax highlighting.

If you add a new language please make yourself available to provide example cases.

To discuss, see freenode channel #altjs.
